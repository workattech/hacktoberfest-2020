## Object Oriented Programming Introduction
### Prerequisites :<br>
It is suggested to know atleast one of the Object Oriented Programming Language like C++ or Java etc.
Before diving into Object Oriented Programming, let us know why it had evolved and what are the other types of Programming paradigms.
- Procedural Programming
- Object Oriented Programming

In procedural Programming everything is broken down into a group of computational steps called as **functions**.<br>  
Some of the disadvantages of Procedural Programming are:
- Security of the data from people working across different levels in the development cycle of code
- Ease of Modification of data.
    
Languages that use Procedural programming paradigm are C,Fortran etc,.

**Object Oriented Programming** is a way of programming in which everything will be in the form of **Objects**.
There two important terms in OOP Classes and Objects.
Class is an imaginary term which we define but we won't allocate memory.It is a blue print of the object that we create.Object is instance of class which has all properties of class in real with memory allocated in stack and Heap(Heap is used when we allocate memory at run time).
A class is composed of Functions which are also called as methods and data.
Functions are used as an interface to access data outside of the class.
There are three types of access specifiers in classes<br>
- **Public**:Anyone function from outside the class can access this data which is declared as public
- **Private**: Only functions of same class can access the data in that class which is declared as Private.
- **Protected** :Both functions of the same class as well as functions of classes which are inheriting from this class can access that data.
Advantages of OOP over conventional programming paradigm:
- The four building blocks of OOP which makes it unique and popular are
    - Inheritance
    - Abstraction
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation

To be precise Abstraction is a way in which complex implementation details are hidden from the end user and giving only functionality to the user.Inheritance is a concept in which we reuse the code that is already present and extend its functionality in other classes from a base class. Polymorphism is used to define to functions in different forms depending on context. Encapsulation is a way of binding data and methods together. Using these properties we are able to get safety and reusability in our code. And it also makes easier when we want to modify the code or update something in it.

**Advice**: It is always adviced to learn anything by actually using it. So start changing your way of writing code by actually using OOPs concepts due to which you can learn practically by coding yourself which is a good practice.
